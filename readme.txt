I did my best on this, and I can't figure out where my errors are and how to fix them,
I really can't find the error, I'm exactly where I was prior to the deadline, and am
submitting late because I thought I could fix the error. I feel that I'm a few lines of code off from a perfect
program, but I really can't figure it out. -Matt Richmond
